From the Juvenile Justice pivot table, we observe a minority of students (~500/51,000) are in Juvenile Justice facilities. The majority of these (85%) are male students.

From the Magnet Schools Pivot Table, we observe that less than 10% of all students attend a Magnet School. There are 1000 more male students than female students in Magnet Schools.

White students make up 50% of the student population with an even split between white males and white females. The second largest group are Hispanic students making up ~26.16% of the student population. This is also roughly split between Hispanic males and Hispanic females.

Two or more races, Asian and Black students make up 3%, 5% and 14% of the student population respectively.

There are a bit more Hispanic students than American Indian, Asian, Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, Black and Two or more Races stduents combined (26.16% vs. 24%). And of course combining these two groups equates to the number of White students.
