    "# Winning Jeopardy\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to compete on Jeopardy, and we're looking for any edge we can get to win. In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help us win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is named `jeopardy.csv`, and contains `20000` rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which we can download [here]. Here's the beginning of the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jeopardy Dataset Preview](images/jeopardy_dataset_preview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Show Number` -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "- `Air Date` -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "- `Round` -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "- `Category` -- the category of the question.\n",
    "- `Value` -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "- `Question` -- the text of the question.\n",
    "- `Answer` -- the text of the answer.\n",
